# FullStackReactStarter
React/Flux frontend, Express backend with server side rendering.

This is a work in progress, my own boilerplate for full stack projects.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ryanjamesmcgill/FullStackReactStarter.git you-project
$ cd your-project
$ npm install
$
$ npm run dev --- This will start the webpack bundling process, it will rebuild as you edit the React app
$ npm run build --- This will start a production build of the React app.
$ npm run start --- This will start the server, defaulting to port 3000
```

Run 'npm run start', and point a browser to `localhost:3000/` and you're up and running!
